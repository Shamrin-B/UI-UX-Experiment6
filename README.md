Aim:

To practice solution ideation, user story creation, scenario development, flow mapping, and information architecture design to improve user experience through structured UX design activities.

Algorithm / Procedure:
Step 1 – Solution Ideation (Crazy 8s / Brainwriting):

Identify a common UX problem — ordering food via a food delivery app.

Use Crazy 8s to sketch 8 low-fidelity ideas to solve it.

Choose one or two promising ideas for further design.

Step 2 – Creating User Stories:

Define a persona (e.g., college student who orders food).

Write at least 5 user stories in the format:
As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [benefit].

Step 3 – Creating Scenarios:

Select one user story.

Create a narrative scenario describing:

the user’s environment

emotional state

the task performed

the system’s response

Step 4 – Flow Diagram / Flow Mapping:

Choose a main task — ordering food via app.

Create a task flow using standard symbols (Start, Decision, Action).

Show each step from app opening to order delivery.

Step 5 – Information Architecture (IA):

Perform card sorting to group related information.

Create a site map showing how users navigate between sections.

Output:
1. Solution Ideation

Problem: Users face confusion while ordering food due to complex navigation and unclear delivery details.
Crazy 8s Ideas:

One-tap reorder of favorite meals.

Voice-based food ordering.

AI suggestions based on time of day.

Live kitchen tracking.

Instant “Order again” on home screen.

Group ordering for friends/family.

Customizable combo meals.

Smart delivery slot suggestion.

2. User Stories

As a student, I want to see nearby restaurants quickly, so that I can choose the fastest delivery option.

As a repeat customer, I want to reorder my previous meal easily, so that I save time.

As a new user, I want to apply promo codes easily, so that I get discounts without confusion.

As a busy person, I want to track my order live, so that I know when to expect delivery.

As a food lover, I want to filter food by taste or mood, so that I find what I’m craving.

3. Scenario

Riya, a college student, opens the food delivery app during her lunch break. The app automatically detects her location and lists nearby restaurants sorted by fastest delivery. She quickly chooses a sandwich shop and places her order in under two minutes. She feels relieved and satisfied because she finishes the task before her next class.
